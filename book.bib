                 Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across

                 background (CAST/EiJ \texttimes{} C57BL/6J). We discovered
                 abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal
                 genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs
                 independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and
                 dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely
                 related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic
                 expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic
                 expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation

                 brought new insights into complex biological phenomena. In
                 particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as
                 transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of
                 cellular composition as well as functional variation in
                 homogenic cell populations. An important step in the
                 single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that
                 belong to the same cell types based on gene expression
                 patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to
                 cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially
                 fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).
                 RESULTS: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named
                 shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell
                 transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared
                 nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling
                 high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of
                 synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq
                 outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More
                 importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the
                 cell types or origins with high accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND

                 routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell
                 level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression
                 analysis is the identification of novel patterns of
                 heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex
                 cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical
                 statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but
                 there is considerable scope for the development of novel
                 statistical approaches that are better adapted to the
                 challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. RESULTS: We have
                 developed a novel agglomerative clustering method that we call
                 pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each
                 cluster branch is associated with a principal component of
                 variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states.
                 Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach
                 to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means
                 and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able
                 to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to
                 broad and detailed cell type labels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel
                 integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical
                 clustering establishes a connection between the representation
                 of the expression data and the number of cell types that can
                 be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs
                 better than either technique in isolation in terms of
                 characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is
                 complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and
                 adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools
                 for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.",

                 pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from
                 embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis,

                 platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96
                 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a
                 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure
                 sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as
                 well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the
                 abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read
                 density and RNA input over the entire detection range and
                 excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed
                 significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure
                 Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly
                 measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC

                 heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with
                 position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias.
                 These effects lead to biased quantification for short

                 for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially

                 intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of
                 healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which
                 algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional
                 single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface
                 phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their
                 intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we
                 defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which
                 led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was
                 predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study
                 presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell
                 heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding
                 insights into AML pathophysiology.",

                 their underlying enzymatic reactions. Here, we show that the
                 fairness of these assumptions varies within libraries:
                 coverage by sequencing reads along and between transcripts
                 exhibits characteristic, protocol-dependent biases. To
                 understand the mechanistic basis of this bias, we present an

                 increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of

                 further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases,
                 artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present
                 in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent
                 on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization.
                 RESULTS: We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater
                 to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control,
                 normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package

                 sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready
                 for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of

              heterogeneous cell populations. As with all genomics experiments,
              batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The
              success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual
              inspection of dimension reduced representations such as principal
              component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high
              number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression.
              Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET,
              https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch
              effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more
              robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch
              effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and
              normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they
              remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our
              results illustrate that batch correction based on
              log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced
              the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets.
              Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data
              integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from
              different publications all charting mouse embryonic development.
              This has important implications for future data integration
              efforts, which will be central to projects such as the Human Cell

              technologies suffer from many sources of significant technical

              sparsity, with typically only 10\% non-zero values. To address

              MAGIC also retains cluster structure, enhances cluster-specific

                 functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient.
                 Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been
                 linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume
                 that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively
                 isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven
                 problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven
                 approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and
                 intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of
                 healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which
                 algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional
                 single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface
                 phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their
                 intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we
                 defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which
                 led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was
                 predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study
                 presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell

                 the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for
                 investigating a wide range of biological and medical
                 questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for
                 drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive
                 and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a
                 detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization
                 and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina
                 transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. RESULTS: We compare
                 statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly
                 DE between two types of biological samples and find that there
                 are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle
                 low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by
                 features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene
                 lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi
                 X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We
                 investigate the impact of the read count normalization method
                 on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling
                 by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We
                 propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures
                 and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our results have significant practical and methodological
                 implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq
                 experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate

                 account for features of the sequencing platform that could

              generate data from different laboratories and at different times
              are rife with batch effects that can fatally compromise
              integration and interpretation of the data. In such cases,
              computational batch correction is critical for eliminating
